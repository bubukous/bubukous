# Competitive Search: Minimax and AB Pruning

# Intro

This is a quick introduction to minimax search in the context of the game Connect 4.  When you you have completed the exercise, you'll be able to play Connect 4 against the minimax agent which you create.

## Getting started

1. Git clone and "npm install"
 
2. To test, "npm test."  IMPORTANT NOTE: Passing the tests does not necessarily mean you've successfully written an intelligent agent.  To test that your agent is really playing well, you'll need to proceed to step 3.

The only file which you should edit to pass these tests is minimax.js.  

2. To run the server, to play against the machine, run "npm start."  If you do this before you've started writing your
agent, you'll note that you're playing against a randomly-playing (i.e., extremely stupid) agent.

Again, the only file which you should need to edit to have an intelligent agent is minimax.js.
